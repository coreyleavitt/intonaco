## Single-dispatcher enforcement (#50).
##
## fresco's design (DESIGN.md → "Concurrency model") assumes a single
## chronos dispatcher per process. Several runtime invariants depend
## on this: chronos's contextvar storage, `typeMarker` first-touch,
## the animation frame clock's threadvars, and the POSIX signal
## handler stack are all single-thread-by-construction.
##
## Most of these failure modes are documented but not enforced. The
## journal layer is different: a multi-thread host that opens the
## same PersistentJournal from two threads (or two dispatchers) gets
## silent, persistent disk corruption. This module is the runtime
## guardrail that catches that case loudly.
##
## ## Usage
##
##   import intonaco/concurrency
##   ...
##   assertDispatcherThread()   # call before any disk-corruption-prone op
##
## First call stamps the current thread as fresco's dispatcher.
## Subsequent calls from a different thread raise
## `MultiDispatcherError`. The stamp is process-global via a single
## atomic CAS, so genuine multi-thread races resolve deterministically
## — the first thread to call wins; everyone else fails closed.
##
## ## Testing override
##
## `dispatcherProbe` is an overridable proc returning "current thread
## id." Defaults to system.getThreadId. Tests replace it to simulate
## cross-thread calls without requiring `--threads:on` for the whole
## suite.

    ## signatures) and is meant to terminate the process loudly.
