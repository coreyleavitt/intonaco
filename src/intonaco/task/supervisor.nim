## OTP-flavored supervisor.
##
## v2.0 surface: oneForOne strategy + lifecycle types
## (`lcPermanent` / `lcTransient` / `lcTemporary`) + restart-rate
## windowing. Other strategies (oneForAll, restForOne) and dynamic
## pools land in v2.3. Per-exception `onError` policies and state-
## restoration on restart land in v2.2.
##
##   let sup = newSupervisor(maxRestarts = 5, within = 10.seconds)
##   sup.addChild("heartbeat", lcPermanent, heartbeatFactory)
##   sup.addChild("agent",     lcTransient, agentFactory)
##   await spawn sup.run()
##
## A factory is `proc(): Future[void]` — the same shape as an async
## proc invocation. The supervisor calls the factory each time it
## (re)starts the child.
