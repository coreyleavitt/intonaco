## Structured concurrency: a `parallel:` block awaits every `spawn`
## inside it as a group. If any child raises, the remaining are
## cancelled and the exception propagates.
##
##   await parallel:
##     spawn taskA()
##     spawn taskB()
##     spawn taskC()
##
## Semantics mirror Kotlin coroutines `coroutineScope` and Trio's
## `async with trio.open_nursery()`. The block returns when all
## children return normally; if a child raises, the cancellation
## cascades synchronously to its siblings before the exception bubbles
## out of the block.
