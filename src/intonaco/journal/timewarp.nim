## Time-warp: project live signals back to historical journal state.
##
##   bindForTimeWarp(cursor)        # cursor: Signal[int] with a label
##   rewindTo(j, eventIdAtCursor)   # scrub: signal sees historical value
##   resumeLive(j)                  # release: back to head state
##
## `bindForTimeWarp` registers a per-signal applier closure keyed by the
## signal's label. The closure parses a writeRepr string and writes
## the parsed value back via `setUntracked` (so projection doesn't
## journal new entries). `rewindTo(j, cutoff)` consults
## `j.stateAt(cutoff)` and invokes the applier for every projected
## label. `resumeLive(j)` re-applies head state, then clears the
## rewinding flag.
##
## Supported value types: int, float, bool, string. Other types fall
## through to a user `restore(repr, T): T` overload (same mechanism as
## restoration.nim's #46 path) — define one in the calling module to
## make a custom signal time-warpable.
##
## Lifetime: `bindForTimeWarp` registers an `onCleanup` against the
## current scope so the applier is unregistered when that scope
## disposes. Calling outside any scope is allowed but the binding
## then lives until process exit (no scope to hang the cleanup on).

  ## Implemented as a **template** so the `when compiles(restore(...))`
  ## branch resolves at the call site — user-defined `restore`
  ## overloads in the caller's module are visible. A generic proc with
  ## `mixin` doesn't propagate through nested generics; template
  ## expansion sidesteps that (same shape as `consumeRestoration`).
  ##
  ## Last-registration-wins per label: rebinding the same label
  ## replaces the prior applier. Labels must be unique among
  ## time-warped signals; sharing a label is a configuration error.
  ##
  ## Lifetime: when called inside a scope, the binding auto-unregisters
  ## on scope dispose (mirrors the cleanup pattern used by `tween` /
  ## `spring`). Outside a scope, the binding lives until process exit.
