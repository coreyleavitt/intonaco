## Signals + effects + computed values with runtime dep tracking.
##
## v2.0 implementation: Solid-flavored eager propagation. A signal
## write synchronously runs every registered observer. The compile-
## time static-graph implementation lands in v2.3 as a drop-in for
## the same surface.
##
## API:
##   let count = signal(0)
##   count()         # read (tracked if inside an effect / computed)
##   count.set(5)    # write
##   createEffect(proc() = echo count())
##   let doubled = createComputed(proc(): int = count() * 2)
##
## Tracking: when a Signal is read inside a Computation's body, the
## Signal records the Computation as an observer; the Computation
## records the Signal as a source. On write, observers re-run. On
## scope dispose, the Computation is marked disposed and removed
## from each of its sources' observer lists.
