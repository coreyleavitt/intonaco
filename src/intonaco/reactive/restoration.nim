## `orReplayJournal` is a `RestartHandler` that walks
## `lastWritesByLabel(prevTid)` and stages each label→writeRepr pair
## in a thread-local table. On the subsequent re-spawn, the new task
## body's `signal(initial, label = "name")` constructions check the
## staging table; if a matching label is present and the writeRepr
## parses as the signal's value type, the parsed value replaces the
## declared initial. Each entry is consumed (read-and-remove) on its
## first match, so a body declaring two signals with the same label
## restores only the first.
##
## Supported types: int, float, bool, string. Other types fall through
## to the declared initial (no auto-restore; user writes a manual
## `onRestart` if needed). Parse failures log to stderr and use the
## initial — corrupt journal entries don't crash the new task.
