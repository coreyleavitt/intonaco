## Speculative scopes — try-a-change-and-decide.
##
##   speculative:
##     editor.text := newText
##     cursor     := newCursor
##     savedAt    := now()
##     if commitReady():
##       commit()
##     # else: auto-rollback on block exit
##
## Semantics:
##   - signal writes inside the block immediately mutate the underlying
##     signal value AND notify observers, so reads inside the block
##     see the new state.
##   - each write also pushes a revert closure onto a frame-local stack.
##   - on `commit()`: the frame is marked committed; revert stack is
##     cleared; writes stick.
##   - on falling out of the block without committing, or on raising:
##     the reverts replay in reverse and observers re-notify, so the
##     world returns to its pre-block state.
##
## **Awaiting inside a speculative body is safe.** `currentSpeculative`
## is a chronos `contextVar`, so the binding propagates through every
## `await` automatically; writes from sibling coroutines see their own
## frame (or none) and don't land on ours.
