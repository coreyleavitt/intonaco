## Ported from fresco's unit suite (pre-split substrate tests coming home).
##
## Speculative revert → notify → resubscribe reentrancy characterization (#51).
##
## The audit flagged `signal.setCore`'s revert closure as "probably safe
## but not characterized." This file pins the contract: cross-signal
## source/observer wiring stays consistent through speculative rollback,
## including conditional reads and write-during-rollback cascades.
